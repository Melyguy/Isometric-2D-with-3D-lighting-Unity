# Isometric 2D scene with 3D-ish lighting

## Heavily inspired by Isocore by JohnBRX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UavoVWHrebM&t=10s

### This project was made so i could learn about isometric tilemaps and making 2d sprites look like they are being lit up in 3d. I did this with the use of normal maps.

## Setup

 - First i designed an isometric cube to use in this project. ![newcube.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bucketio/img15/main/2025/11/27/1764231287191-9ac9672a-0222-4f1a-84e9-c81c16964124.png 'newcube.png')
  - I then made a normal map texture for the cube.

## Tilemap

  - I spent some time figuring out how unity's tilemap system and I finally figured out how to make a tilemap of these cubes.
