# Isometric 2D scene with 3D-ish lighting

## Heavily inspired by Isocore by JohnBRX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UavoVWHrebM&t=10s

### This project was made so i could learn about isometric tilemaps and making 2d sprites look like they are being lit up in 3d. I did this with the use of normal maps.


----

 - I first made a tilemap of isometric cubes. Isometric design is basically just seeing a 2d object from a corner.  	![Isometric grass](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipOXZAbvpecgXEFxg4kPirwSTeaYcxOaTGfeVQZJ)
